👋 Hey, I’m @savtemp

Thanks for stopping by my github page! I am a Teaching Assistant and Full-Stack Software Developer at Boise CodeWorks. After completing a dual major in Biology and Psychology from Boise State University, I made the exciting decision to explore my passion for software development. I've always chased challenges, and pushed myself to go above and beyond my goals, and I love programming for that reason - every day I'm awarded the opportunity to tackle new concepts, problem solve, and create projects that I am passionate about!


🌱 I’m currently honing my skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, MVC Pattern, Node.js, Vue, C#, and MySQL ..With more to come


A little bit about me...

- 💞️ I volunteer with a number of advocacy organizations. My favorite role is being a Big Sister mentor with Big Brothers, Big Sisters
- 🏋🏻‍♀️ I enjoy lifting heavy objects in my local CrossFit gym
- 🥾 I am an avid hiker and backpacker working towards thru-hiking the PCT
- 💆🏻‍♀️ When I'm not outside, you can find me relaxing with a good book, watching anime, or playing video-games
